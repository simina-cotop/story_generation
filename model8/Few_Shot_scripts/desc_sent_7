The chart shows what causes obesity.
We can see that fast food accounts for a high percentage of this at 60% whilst genetic follows at 30% and lack of exercise at 10%.
Fast food is the major cause of obesity at 60% with lack of exercise at 10% but genetics is 30% of leading causes.
60% of fast food causes obesity
Fast food is the major cause of obesity at 60%.
Genetics plays a significant role at 30%.
Lack of exercise is only 10%.
The chart represents what the main causes of obesity are and the bar chart shows the following 3 areas.
The largest cause is due to the intake of fast food.
This contributes to 60% of the cause.
This is followed by genetics at 30% and finally a lack of exercise at 10%.
The chat shows that Fast Food is twice as likely as Genetics to cause obesity.
It also shows that lack of exercise is only 10% likely to cause obesity.
The table shows that the leading cause of Obesity is Fast food (60%) , followed by Genetics (30%) and finally lack of exercise (10%).
This chart shows causes of obesity by percentage.
60% of obesity cases are caused by fast food ; 30% are genetic and 10% are due to lack of exercise.
Unfortunately the chart doesn't show the cases where more than one of these causes may have played an influence on why someone is obese.
Fast food is the highest cause of obesity with 60% of cases.
It is double the next highest cause - genetic on 30% and 6 times lack of exercise which only causes 10% of cases.
This graph highlights the causes of obesity.
It indicates that fast food is a 60% cause of obesity whilst a lack of exercise is 10% of the cause.
Genetic causes amount for 30%.
This chart shows that fast food is the most likely cause of obesity on average , followed by genetic factors , and is least likely to be caused by lack of exercise.
Graph shows the causes of Obesity by percentage.
60% is caused by fast food , followed by genetics at 30% and the smallest at 10% is lack of exercise.
The primary cause of obesity is over-consumption of fast food with 60% of obesity cases being related to this type of diet.
Genetics also contributes to significant amount of cases by 30%.
Lack of exercise is contributes to just 10% of cases.
This is a graph showing different causes of obesity.
It shows 60% of it's caused by fast food , a third of it is due to genetic factors , and just under 10% of obesity is due to lack of exercise.
This graph shows that 60% of obesity is caused by fast food.
Only 10% is caused by lack of exercise whilst 30% is genetic
This graphs illustrates the causes of obesity.
60% of obesity is caused by fast food , 30% by genetics and 10% by lack of exercise.
this graph shows the causes of obesity , the greatest contributor is fast food with 60% follows by genetic factors with 30% and lack of exercise making up the remaining 10%
Fast food is the highest factors in causing obesity
This chart displays causes of obesity.
The highest percentage of obesity cases would be because of fast food at 60% , followed by genetic reasons at 30% and then lack of exercise at 10%.
This graph shows three potential causes of obesity , and breaks down their relative contribution.
Fast food emerges as the most important , followed by genetic factors.
Lack of exercise is comparatively unimportant to these other two factors.
Fast food is the leading cause of obesity at 60% , followed by genetics at 30% and a lack of exercise at 10%
This graph shows what causes obesity or is a factor in someone becoming obese.
60% Fast food \\n 30% Genetic \\n 10% Lack of Exercises
Fast food causes 60% of obesity , genetic predisposition some 30% whilst lack of exercise contributes the other 10%
