This chart shows the average annual salary for software engineers relative to their degree.
We can see that those who have no degree have a lower salary than those who have a Bachelors degree.
Those with a Masters or a PhD on average earn much more.
The chart shows that with a PhD degree Software engineers earn the highest with over 20000 more than no degrees and Bachelor.
Masters is only 15000 behind PhD but shows more studies are needed for higher salaries.
Those who have a PhD do well in terms of salary than those who do not
There is an equal increase between engineers ' salaries from Bachelor through Master to PhD.
Engineers with no degree were worse off than Bachelor ' s salaries by approximately 10%.
The median salary of software engineers with respect to their degrees is shown as follows.
Those with no degree are the lowest at 30% , those with a Bachelors degree come in at 45%.
With a Masters degree , the engineers median salary is at 55% and finally , those with a PhD are at the highest level of 65%.
This shows that Software Engineers with PhDs earn more than their counterparts.
The lowest salaries are to those who have no degree , followed by a Bachelors degree then a Masters degree - therefore we can take from this graph that the higher the level of education, the higher the salary Software Engineers earn per year
The table shows that Software engineers with PhDs earn the most , earning a median salary of over $60,000.
Masters degree graduates come 2nd earning on average $ 55,000.
Then comes Bachelors Degree graduates , earning $ 45,000 on average.
Finally those with no degree earn the least , earning just over $ 30,000 on average.
This charts shows the average median salary per year for software engineers with respect to their degree type.
Not surprisingly , those with no degree earn the least ; and those with a PhD earn the most.
There is a difference of about $ 30,000 between these average earnings.
This graph shows a trend that the higher the qualifications held by software engineer , the greater the salary they receive.
Those with no degree receive almost half of the salary received by those with a PHd.
Education increases earning potential.
The graphs shows the median salary of software engineers with respect to their degree.
We can see that there is an approximately Â £ 20,000 salary difference between those with a Bachelor degree and those with a PhD but only an approximate Â £ 10,000 difference between those with a degree and those without.
This chart shows that software engineers who have a PhD degree earn more money than software engineers with lesser degrees.
The chart demonstrates that the higher the degree, the more money earned on average.
This chart shows the Median Salary of Software Engineers by degree level.
The largest salary of 62 k are those with a PhD , followed by 52 k for those with a Masters , 42 k for those with a Bachelor degree and the smallest 32 k for those with no degree.
Students who have completed Bachelor , Masters and PhD courses earn significantly more than those with no degree.
This graph shows the median annual salary in $1000s for software engineers with respect to their original degree.
Those with a PhD earn the most at $ 62,000.
A Master's degree gets average earnings of $ 52,000 , whilst a BSc gets $ 42,000 on average.
Those with no degree average a salary of $ 30,000.
This graph shows that the median salary a software engineer earns increases as the level of their degree rises.
Those with a PhD earn over $ 60,000 about $ 10,000 per year more than those with a Masters degree , who in turn earn about $ 10,000 per year more than those with a Bachelor degree.
Those with no degree earn the least at about $ 35,000 per year.
This graph shows the median salary for Software Engineers dependent on degree level.
Persons holding PhD level earn the highest , followed by Masters , then Bachelors and finally no degree.
this chart shows median salary per year for software engineers with respect in their degree , those with a PhD look to earn over 60,000 , followed by Masters with 50,000 \\n Bachelors with over 40,000 and no degree 30,000.
showing that evidence indicates that the high education you have completed the higher your wage salary will be
The higher level of education the higher the salary
This chart displays the median salary per year of software engineers depending on their degree.
Those with a PhD earn the most with 64,000 , then Masters at 54,000 , then Bachelor at 44,000 and those in the field with no degree earn 34,000.
This corresponds with what you would expect that those with a better education and more knowledge earn more
This graph plots the median salary for software engineers split by their level of qualifications.
PhD holders earn the highest median salary , followed by Masters holders , then Bachelors.
Non-degree holders earn about half what PhD holders do.
Software engineers who achieved a higher degree of further education and higher degree qualification earn a higher salary.
The average salary of a software engineer base on their level.
$ 45000 for a BA/BSc \\n $ 55000 for a MA/MSc \\n $ 65000 for a PhD \\n $ 35000 for No degree
63 k is median salary for software engineers who have a PhD , 56 k for a Masters , 44 k for a Bachelor degree , but only 35 k with no degree
