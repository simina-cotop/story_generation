The graph shows how women are represented within different departments across a university.
The highest percentage is 70% of women in Literature.
This is followed by the arts at 60%.
30% of women are represented in engineering and then lastly at 20% , computer science.
The chart shows how woman representation is highest in the Literature and Arts departments of university.
The lowest representations are in Mathematics with just 10% , followed by computer science with 20% and Engineering with 30%
The table shows women are most well represented in university Literature department (70%) , followed by Arts (60%) , Engineering (30%) , Computer science (20%) and math (10%).
The chart shows the percentage of women in different university departments.
In math , there is only 10% women , but in literature there is 70%.
Arts also has more than half women , while computer science and engineering have more than half men.
Women are represented in their highest figures in literature (70% of students) and the arts (60% of students).
Their representation is much lower in engineering (30%) , computer science (20%) and math (just 10%).
The graph shows the percentage of women represented in various university departments.
We can see that they are most represented in literature and arts departments but least represented in computer science and mathematics.
This chart demonstrates how many women are in each university department.
70% of people in the literature department are female , compared to 60% in Arts , 30% in Engineering , 20% in computer science and 10% in Math.
This may be because there is less emphasis placed on encouraging women into STEM subjects, and there are and under representation of women in this area.
This graph shows the percentage of women per University Department.
The largest percentage is on Literature then Arts , followed by Engineering, computer science then Math
Women are represented well in the arts and literature , but are significantly under-represented in Computer Science, Math and Engineering.
